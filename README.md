# dayplanner
this is my attempt at creating a Dayplanner using javascript, bootstrap, and minute. I got it to store the inputs in local storage, but I can't get my buttons to turn blue, and I can't tell if the "past, present, future" classes are working or not. But overall I'm quite proud with how it turned out.
